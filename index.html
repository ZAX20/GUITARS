      <h2>The Things That Is GOAT In Musical Instruments</h2>

      <header>1.WHAT IS GUITAR?</header>

      <p>
        The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six
        strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by
        strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while
        simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers
        of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be
        used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either
        acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or
        amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier. The guitar is
        classified as a chordophone – meaning the sound is produced by a
        vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. Historically, a
        guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut. Steel
        guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in
        the United States;[1] nylon strings came in the 1940s.[1] The guitar's
        ancestors include the gittern, vihuela, the four-course Renaissance
        guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to
        the development of the modern six-string instrument.

        guitar, Plucked stringed instrument. It normally has six strings, a
        fretted fingerboard, and a soundbox with a pronounced waist. It probably
        originated in Spain in the early 16th century. By 1800 it was being
        strung with six single strings; 19th-century innovations gave it its
        modern form. Modern classical guitar technique owes much to Francisco
        Tárrega (1852–1909), and Andrés Segovia gave the instrument prominence
        in the concert hall. However, it has always been primarily an amateur’s
        instrument, and it remains an important folk instrument in many
        countries. The 12-string guitar is strung in six double courses. The
        Hawaiian, or steel, guitar is held horizontally and the strings are
        stopped by the pressure of a metal bar, producing a sweet glissando
        tone. The electric guitar represented a major development. Electric
        pickups were attached to the acoustic guitar in the 1920s. In the 1940s
        Les Paul invented the solid-body guitar; lacking a soundbox, it
        transmits only the string vibrations. With its long-sustained notes,
        affinity for strong amplification, and capacity for producing wailing
        melodic lines as well as harshly percussive rhythms, it soon became the
        principal instrument of Western popular music. There are three main
        types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish
        guitar/nylon-string guitar); the steel-string acoustic guitar or
        electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's
        lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar
        (typically with a large sound hole) or an archtop guitar, which is
        sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic guitar is
        produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the
        guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar
        is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle
        technique where each strings is plucked individually by the player's
        fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can
        also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and
        country guitar playing in the United States.

        <h2>The Acoustic</h2>
        <p>
          An acoustic guitar is a guitar with a hollow body that amplifies the
          vibration of the strings acoustically. An acoustic guitar doesn't
          require external electronic amplification in order to be comfortably
          heard.

        <h2>The Electric</h2>
        <p>
          An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in
          order to be heard at typical performance volumes, unlike a standard
          acoustic guitar however combinations of the two - a semi-acoustic
          guitar and an electric acoustic guitar exist. It uses one or more
          pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical
          signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.

        <h2>The Bass</h2>
        <p>
          The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched
          member of the string family. It is a plucked string instrument similar
          in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar,
          but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six
          strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely
          replaced the double bass in popular music.

          The ukulele, also called Uke, is a member of the lute family of
          instruments of Portuguese origin and popularized in Hawaii. It
          generally employs four nylon strings. The tone and volume of the
          instrument vary with size and construction.

        <h2>The Classical</h2>
        <p>
          The classical guitar (also known as the nylon-string guitar or Spanish
          guitar) is a member of the guitar family used in classical music and
          other styles. An acoustic wooden string instrument with strings made
          of gut or nylon, it is a precursor of the modern acoustic and electric
          guitars, both of which use metal strings.

        <h2>The Electro-Acoustic</h2>
        <p>
          Commonly known as acoustic-electric guitars, this guitar type is
          somewhere halfway between acoustic and electric guitars. The overall
          design is pretty much the same as on acoustic guitars. However, they
          also feature pickups, which allows them to be much louder.

        <h2>The Twelve Strings</h2>
        <p>
          A twelve-string guitar is a steel-string guitar with 12 strings in six
          courses, which produces a thicker, more ringing tone than a standard
          six-string guitar. Typically, the strings of the lower four courses
          are tuned in octaves, with those of the upper two courses tuned in
          unison.

        <h2>The Resonator</h2>
        <p>
          A resonator guitar or resophonic guitar is an acoustic guitar that
          produces sound by conducting string vibrations through the bridge to
          one or more spun metal cones, instead of to the guitar's sounding
          board.

        <h2>Semi-Hollow</h2>
        <p>
          In the 1930s, guitar manufacturers aimed at increasing the sound level
          produced by the instrument, to compete with louder instruments such as
          the drums.[2][3] Companies such as Gibson, Rickenbacker and Gretsch
          focused on amplifying a guitar through a loudspeaker. In 1936, Gibson
          introduced their first manufactured semi-acoustic guitars, the
          ES-150s.

          An archtop guitar is a hollow electric or semi-acoustic guitar with a
          full body and a distinctive arched top, whose sound is particularly
          popular with jazz, blues, and rockabilly players.

          A multi-neck guitar is a guitar that has multiple fingerboard necks.
          They exist in both electric and acoustic versions. Although multi-neck
          guitars are quite common today, they are not a modern invention.
          Examples of multi-neck guitars and lutes go back at least to the
          Renaissance.

          The harp guitar is a guitar-based stringed instrument generally
          defined as a "guitar, in any of its accepted forms, with any number of
          additional unstopped strings that can accommodate individual
          plucking." The word "harp" is used in reference to its harp-like
          unstopped open strings.
